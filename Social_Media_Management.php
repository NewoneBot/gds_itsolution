                                        <p>Social Networks are used by users to communicate with each other and find
                                            useful information to complete the purchase process. Do you want to build an
                                            engaged community that supports your brand?</p>
                                        <p>The companies do not make purchases, establish relationships, and they do it
                                            not only in the office or at home, but increasingly from mobile phones,
                                            iPhones, PDAs while they are on the move or at the precise moment in which
                                            they need information.</p>
                                        <p>The online communication scenario today is varied but can be enclosed in
                                            these areas:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Social Networks:</strong>Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter,
                                                YouTube, etc., allow users to create relationships, exchange
                                                information, and communicate by keeping judgments and contents online
                                                (writings, photos, videos).</li>
                                            <li><strong>Portals &amp; Community:</strong>discussion forum; newsgroup;
                                                comparison portals with comments and ratings.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Influencer</strong>: blogs and social channels of people who
                                                have been able to build authority and a following.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>In and with Social Networks, companies and users establish relationships,
                                            exchange information, and influence the perceived image of the Brand,
                                            companies, and their products or services. On informational websites,
                                            information about products and services proliferates without the company
                                            doing anything. It is users who review, test, comment, and post content
                                            about them.</p>
                                        <p>Before making a purchase, users increasingly sift the comments on these
                                            portals and Social Networks to understand if the product or service they are
                                            about to buy is valid or not and seek comfort on the opinions of other
                                            users. And after the purchase, they leave their opinion contributing to the
                                            continuous growth of “buzz” around the company.</p>
