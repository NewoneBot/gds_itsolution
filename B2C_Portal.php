                                        <h2><strong>Development of B2C web portals</strong></h2>
                                        <p>With the wording B2C, we mean, in the world of commerce, the synthesis of
                                            Business to consumer, or that particular relationship between the producer
                                            or suppliers of goods and services and the final consumer, or the user. The
                                            acronym finds application above all in the digital market in association
                                            with internet services, and it is for this reason that today we talk more
                                            and more about how to create ready and functional B2C web portals, which
                                            enable the entrepreneur to offer users a clear, immediate and engaging user
                                            experience.</p>
                                        <p>The aim is, of course, to increase brand loyalty in the brand, with the
                                            fundamental aim of increasing sales and turnover. This is especially true
                                            for those suppliers of goods and services that make the image and the clear
                                            and captivating presentation of their offers the strong point of their sales
                                            strategy, such as tourist portals: it follows then that these professionals
                                            need guidance on how to create professional, reliable and serious B2C web
                                            portals since it is especially on this aspect that the economic gain passes.
