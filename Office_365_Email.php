                                        <p>Very true, just go to the Microsoft website to activate one or more licenses
                                            of the service and pay for it, the same price you would pay for buying the
                                            service from Gaytri Devi Soultions.</p>
                                        <p>The difference is in the configuration of the Suite. Our work consists of the
                                            correct parameterization according to real business needs. Who can access
                                            the data? Who sees what? For example, a company may need to manage separate
                                            contact books according to the roles of each individual person. Not
                                            necessarily everyone has to access the Customers or Suppliers list!</p>
                                        <p>Not to mention the Corporate Calendars. Meetings &amp; Meetings, appointments
                                            with customers, personal appointments must be able to be managed in a
                                            precise and prudent way, according to one’s roles and to the organizational
                                            chart and Company procedures.</p>

                                            specific rules and needs that must be respected. And this is what we do in a
                                            precise and responsible way every day for our Customers, thanks also to the

                                        <p>If a user purchases a Microsoft Office 365 License, obviously, he has online
                                            support available, but which always starts from a first-level Assistance.
