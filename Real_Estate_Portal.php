                                        <p><strong>The advantages of a real estate portal for your real estate
                                                business</strong></p>
                                        <p>Today every business should have an online presence. Building a reputable
                                            brand and connecting with today’s customers is nearly impossible as the
                                            website is the corporate digital institutional face. Here are the main
                                            benefits associated with developing and maintaining a portal as a real
                                            estate agency.</p>
                                        <p><strong>SEO and Search Engine Visibility</strong></p>
                                        <p>The creation of a portal allows you to associate your content with your name
                                            and drive traffic to your listings. Essentially it increases your
                                            visibility. Just like a for sale sign on a busy street, a portal with good
                                            content makes “passersby” look at it twice.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Territorial relevance</strong></p>
                                        <p>As a real estate agency, you want to be seen as a prominent agency in your
                                            area. This could mean an entire state, city or neighbourhood. Whatever your
                                            area, a website allows you to improve your relevance in the area. People
                                            constantly see your name linked to a specific location and start associating
                                            you with it. Therefore, when they go to sell or buy, they naturally
                                            gravitate towards you.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Acquiring contacts</strong></p>
                                        <p>Exposing your content on the web doesn’t close a deal. In the end, you have
                                            to convert the leads (those who fill out an online form to be contacted and
                                            know more about the services you offer) into customers and conclude the
                                            deal. The wonderful thing about a real estate portal is that it allows you
                                            to acquire leads in a somewhat passive way.</p>
                                        <p>With a real estate portal, there is no need to make phone calls or manually
                                            send emails constantly. All you need is to have a good portal and embed a
                                            conversion (contact) form on your site at strategic points such as within
                                            property listings. If a visitor wants more information, they fill out the
                                            form and provide their contact details. From there, you know you have a “hot
                                            contact” (someone who already knows your company and wants to find out
                                            more), and you can close the sale properly.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Social Proof</strong></p>
                                        <p>Sellers want to know that you can sell their home at the best price and that
                                            you can sell it quickly. Buyers want to be sure that you know the market and
                                            you will help them get their dream home at the lowest possible price. You
                                            can use all the right words to convince them, but in the end, they want some
                                            evidence to back up your claims. A real estate portal is a great source of
                                            Social Proof.</p>
                                        <p>Now that you understand the importance of having a good real estate portal,
                                            you may be wondering what it takes to create the real estate portal for your
