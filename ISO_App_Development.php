            <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: 400;">The development of Android apps starts
                from the design of the UX / UI, integrating the desired contents
                and functionalities. The app must, in fact, be functional and useful to the user, differing consistently
                from the mobile website. Therefore, creating Android apps means emphasizing features and operations that
                must be at hand, managing to give the user what he needs in a few “taps”. This improves the customer
                experience and multiplies the sales opportunities. Furthermore, the development of mobile apps

            <h3><strong>Why develop an ISO app</strong></h3>
            <p>Below you will find some reasons to choose Android app and game development:</p>
            <p><strong>Distribution-&nbsp;</strong>Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world, and
                being open source allows customization by the various smartphone manufacturers.</p>
            <p><strong>Flexibility-&nbsp;</strong>The creation of apps or the development of games for Android allows
                you to cover multiple devices with different price ranges.</p>
            <p><strong>Creativity-&nbsp;</strong>It does not set limits and has no rigid guidelines to follow for
                graphic development, thus giving full freedom to designers.</p>
            <p><strong>Agency for the development of Android applications in Delhi</strong></p>
            <p>Gaytri Devi Soultions has specialized in&nbsp;<strong><a
                        href="https://Gaytri Devi Soultions/android-app-development/">Android app development in
                        India</a>&nbsp;</strong>for many years and has created quality products to meet customer needs.

                team also make sure to develop android apps that meet all the necessary requirements to be distributed
                in the stores.</p>

            <p><strong>Our ISO app development solution for you</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Strategy-&nbsp;</strong>A solid plan and strategy is the key to android app development. We are
                here for your idea to explore and discuss, to grasp what you want to achieve with your app – i.e. What
                is the real problem you are trying to solve and who is your target group.</p>
            <p><strong>MPV development-&nbsp;</strong>Often, the first end of an Android application development journey
                is the creation of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Along the way, wireframing and communication are key
                to building the optimal UX for your audience. An MVP is the ideal starting point for a mature
                application to grow.</p>
            <p><strong>Modern application development-&nbsp;</strong>Android application development is based on Java
                and Kotlin. Every Android application must follow the latest trends in the industry. We base our mobile
                developments on the latest native application technologies and tailor the functions and scope of the
                application to your budget and schedule.</p>
