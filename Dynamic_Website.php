                As technology, trends, and customer preferences evolve, it’s important for website owners to keep their
                sites up-to-date as well. With a dynamic website, this is easily possible. Having a dynamic website
                means; have the freedom to make changes as and when required. Unlike static websites, dynamic websites
                display different content on different pages. Hence, a visitor never gets bored and is constantly busy.
