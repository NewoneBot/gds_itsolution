                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: 400;">A successful multi-seller
                        platform
                        cannot do without the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simple checkout:</strong>facilitating the payment by designing short and engaging

                        <li><strong>Order monitoring</strong>: the automated order status procedure is essential to give
                            the
                            customer confidence, putting him in a position to have the shipment under control (e.g.
                            order
                            tracking code).</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment options:</strong>the multiple payment functionality with secure systems
                            makes
                            the shopping experience better and encourages the completion of the order.</li>

                        customers for the success of an online sale. Here’s how a multi-seller platform can effectively
                        support them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Easy shipping:</strong>standard national rates, management of packaging methods and
                            returns management are key aspects for those who decide to sell online.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dashboard:</strong>The control panel must allow the seller to manage the profile and
                            products, including sales and inventory, as well as provide information on the status of
                            payments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong>: It is essential for online sellers to analyze how online
                            traffic is generated and who the customers are to optimize conversion strategies.</li>
