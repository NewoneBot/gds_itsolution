                                            <span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Business cards have always been
                                                considered a staple of the business and professional world since they
                                                offer the opportunity to show all your contacts at once, thus increasing
                                                the chances of continuing the conversation if given to someone.</span>

                                                hasn’t changed when it comes to their digital version, which is easy to

                                                one view.</span>

                                            <span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">The main purpose of the digital
                                                version of the business card is the same as its paper counterpart: to
                                                help professionals connect more easily with customers, partners, and
                                                colleagues. The virtual option has become even more important in the
                                                current global pandemic situation.</span>
